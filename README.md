# Min Relay API

**NOTE: Created to suit higher education in Norway; makes use of Dataporten (UNINETT) for client/user (O)Authentication.**
 
Min Relay API is a simple API that provides information pertaining to an account holder's content in TechSmith Relay. 
 
All information is drawn directly from Relay's own DB (read-only!), except:
 
- Delete functionality, reads/writes to data source defined by https://github.com/skrodal/techsmith-relay-presentation-delete
- Hits, reads from data source generated by https://github.com/skrodal/relay-iis-logparser
 
 ## Requirements
 
The API must 
 
- be registered with UNINETT Dataporten 
    - with defined scope: `user`
    - and access to the following Dataporten scopes: `userid-feide`, `email`, `userid` 
 
## Dependencies
 
- UNINETT Dataporten
- Alto Router
- Client (Min Relay)

Code/docs for the client, Min Relay, for which this API was developed may be found [here](https://github.com/skrodal/min-relay).
